# Exercise

## Ingress resources

1. Delete the Service for your deployment that you created yesterday
2. Add an ingress to yesterdays deployment
3. Check the external-dns logs for the creation of your DNS record. **Note:** Please donâ€™t try to resolve your DNS record before you verified with the external-dns logs as your resolver may cache a non-existing record for quite a long time.
4. Your exercise-app should be available by its DNS name now. It should have a valid TLS certficate and redirect all traffic to HTTPS.

If you arrived here, please let us know.
